# simple-plug-ins
A simple plug-in application for beginners who want to familiarize themselves with python and nodejs - javascript.
I choose to utilize a command-line interface for the task to prioritize simplicity and ease of use. 
By implementing the code in JavaScript, all Python files are automatically registered as plugins. This streamlines the entire process, making it simpler and easier to understand.

# usage
`nodejs calculator.js`

Then follow the instruction for addition, substraction and multiplication. 
Feel free to modify and add more methods if you want.
