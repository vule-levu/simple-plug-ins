# simple-plug-ins
A simple plug-in application for students or those starting to get themselves familiar with python and javascript.
I chose to utilize a command-line interface for the task to prioritize simplicity and ease of use. 
The implemented code in JavaScript automatically registers all Python files as plugins, simplifying the process.

# usage
`nodejs calculator.js`

Then follow the instruction for addition, substraction and multiplication. 
Feel free to modify and add more methods if you want.
